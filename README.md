# Anvil

[CI](http://ci.anvilpowered.org) (Release candidate jars)

Anvil is a mineraft plugin api that aims to help developers create structured cross-platform plugins. Included is an entity framework and many services that abstract platform-specific actions so that they can be used in common code.

Anvil is not only cross-platform in the context of plugin platforms, but also in the context of databases. Currently, MongoDB and Xodus are supported, with SQL on the way. With Anvil, you can write a central abstract set of logic that applies to several database types.
