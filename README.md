# Anvil

Anvil is a Minecraft plugin development framework designed to target multiple platforms.

You are able to write plugin code once, and it will be able to deploy to multiple server platforms, including:

Sponge, Spigot, and Velocity. Plans in the future are Nukkit (Bedrock Edition).

A special feature of Anvil that makes development here special is you are allowed to write platform-specific code and still deploy that plugin to a different server platform.

For example, you have a minigame plugin and you want to write some Sponge specific code for any reason. You can do that while still using the same plugin build on Spigot, albeit that code will not be used.
